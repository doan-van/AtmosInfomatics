# This is a toy program to build U-net NN for downscaling temperature with a case study of Tibet

> need to learn about U-net architecture

> U-net is CNN without fully connected layer 


## Steps

### Step 1: preparing input data

General note: there are three categories of data (like any other ML approaches):

- training data
- validation data
- testing data

Each includes
-

- low-resolution data
- high-resolution data

high-res data is used as ground truth for training as well as for validating and testing

both low- and high-res data have the sample pixel size.
